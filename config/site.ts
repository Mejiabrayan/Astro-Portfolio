Greetings! I am Brayan Mejia, a seasoned Front-End Developer crafting digital experiences from the heart of innovation, San Francisco, CA. Since embarking on this journey in 2019, my hands have danced across keyboards, breathing life into web applications with a tapestry of technologies such as React, Next.js, and Supabase, to name a few.

In the ever-evolving world of tech, I've honed my skills through diverse projects, each teaching me the delicate balance between form and function, aesthetics and efficiency.
